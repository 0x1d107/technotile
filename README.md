# Technotile - open source tile game engine
WIP. Much of the things aren't implemented. 
Will probably very slowly evolve into a factorio-like game.

## Deadline? 
When it's done. (probably never. Could be abandoned but I hope not this time)

## License? 
Idk, but I will choose something (A)GPL-like for the code.
[json11](https://github.com/dropbox/json11) library has MIT license.
Tile sprites are public domain.
The [font](https://opengameart.org/content/minimalist-pixel-fonts) by kheftel is published under CC0 license.
